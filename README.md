Some recommended Mac OSX apps that I've discovered along the way while onboarding my new Macbook Pro:

Open Source
1.  [Rectangle App](https://rectangleapp.com/) - Move and resize windows in macOS using keyboard shortcuts or snap areas

Free
1.  [Scroll Reverser](https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/) - Scroll Reverser is a free Mac app that reverses the direction of scrolling, with independent settings for trackpads and mice. (Including Magic Mouse.)
